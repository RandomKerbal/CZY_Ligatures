"""
Requires:
    pip install fonttools

What it does:
    - Adds the OpenType features from the .fea file into the provided TTF.
    - Renames the font family, fullname, postscript names, so OS sees it as a different font.
    - Prints a short report of glyph names referenced in the .fea that are missing from the font (you may need to import those glyphs from a math font).
